HTML documents in different sections in order to apply some form of styling
or post-processing (like manipulating them with javascript) to them.-->

        <div id="div-tag">
            <p>
                The div tag is a block type HTML element. This means that
                it covers a whole block of the HTML document. Therefore,
                when included, it automatically separates vertically the elements that
                sorround it. Furthermore, its boundaries,
                when unchanged, cover the whole horizontal span of the document.
                Actually, you can this here, in that the css-styled green background of
                the element covers completely the strip of the document where this text lies.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The span tag is an inline HTML element. <span id="span-tag">This means that it only
            covers the section of HTML document needed to cover the line/s of text
            or elements it includes, like you can see here. It also wraps around the different text lines
            it covers, as it does here. This is why its called inline, since it is used
            to modify only the style of behavior of a specific snippet of text of the larger 
            set of lines of text it is placed inside of.</span>  After the text covered by
            the span tag, the styling applied  to it ends and the rest of the text continous
            with the previous styling it had before.
