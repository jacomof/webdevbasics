            This text is styled by the fifth rule, since it is the matching rule with
            the higher precedence! While the following list elements are styled
            by the fourth and fifth rules, since they match the ascendant and the
            elements themselves. In case of attribute conflict, like the case 
            of the text color, the rules that match the children directly have 
            higher precedence than that of the antecessor, even it this last one
            has higher specificity.
