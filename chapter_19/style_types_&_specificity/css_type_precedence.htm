<!--CSS document to showcase the different type of CSS styles-->
<!--In CSS there are two main types to classify styles in an HTML document. 
First, the they can be classified by the styles' author: 
    *1 Styles defined by the author of the document
    *2 User defined styles
    *3 Browser's default styles.
Secondly, they can be classified by the way the were created:
    *1 Inline styles
    *2 Internal styles
    *3 External Styles
The different ways styles can be created means that conflicts may arise
when styles from different classifications affect the same elements.
To resolve them, CSS uses a method known as cascading. In this method,
each of the different types of classifications of the same type
have a priority (in the classification above, the number represent the
precedence (the lower the higher the priority)) and only the rule with
the highest priority is applied. For example, inline styles are prioritized
above internal styles, etc...-->
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>CSS document type precedence</title>
        <style>
            @import url('styles/type_precedence.css');
            p {text-decoration: underline;}
        </style>
    </head>
    <!--The inline rule being applied is the one who will render
    when the document is visualized in the browser due to its precedence.-->
    <p style="text-decoration: red overline;">
        Hello there, this is some text to showcase type precedence in CSS.
    </p>

    <!--However, on the following element the internal style for text deco-
    ration will be applied, given that it0 has higher precedence than the external styles-->
    <p id="parag">
        Hello again. This is yet another piece of text to showcase type
        precedence in CSS.
    </p>
    <!--This element will be styled by the external css document given that
        it has no internal or inline style being applied to it-->
