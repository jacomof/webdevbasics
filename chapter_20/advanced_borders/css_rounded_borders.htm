    <h1>Rounding the edges</h1>
    <!--Div elements with different configurations of round borders.-->
    <div class="one-rounding">
        This is a div element with uniform and equal borders across all edges.
    </div>
    <div class="two-rounding">
        This div element's round edges are specified with two arguments.
        Top left and bottom right edges are equal, just like top right and
        bottom left corners are equal as well. 
    </div>
    <div class="three-rounding">
        This div element's round edges are specified with three arguments.
        Top right and bottom left coreners are equal.
    </div>
    <div class="four-rounding">
        This div element's round edges are specified with four arguments.
    </div>
    <div class="individual-rounding">
        This div element's round edges are specified individually through
        the four properties that define round borders (border-top-left-radius,
        border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-left-radius & 
        border-bottom-right-radius). As you can see, the same effect as with
        the rounding with four arguments can be achieved, since the latter is just
        a short version of the former.
    </div>
    <div class="ellipsis-rounding">
        This div element has ellipse-shaped borders, since the / operator
        is used when specifying its borders' rounding.
    </div>
